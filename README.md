A tower-defence card game - theme "combine two incompatible genres"

### Day 1: 21-04-2018
I started Ludum Dare as I often start a game jam; throwing together a build system I can live with, spending slightly
too long on it and then getting started properly after that. It seems to be a constant theme for me that my code and
build scripts are too engineered for game-jams.

That said, given that I approach most game jams either as a learning experience or the chance to give my
game engines / frameworks a test, it's not the worst thing in the world to spend a little extra time on the quality.

Pretty quickly, I ran into a segfault which I'd managed to introduce during my work on [APG](https://github.com/SgtCoDFish/APG)
earlier in the week, while preparing for Ludum Dare. It wasn't too bad to fix, especially with CLion's valgrind
integration.

Another obvious choice was that since I was working alone, I'd be using whatever I could find for free in terms of
sprites, fonts, graphics and music. [Kenney](http://kenney.nl/) was an excellent source of art, as ever.

#### Day 1 Progress
I didn't really get any gameplay in, which was sort of my goal. I anticipate I should have some actual game mechanics
done by about halfway tomorrow, giving me about a day to polish and about half a day to prepare for distribution.

For now, sleep.
